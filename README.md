### Problem Statement
This service is for the professionals who can work remotely and don't really need to live near
their workplace. Sometimes you start searching for an apartment in the city where you work, but 
if you have the flexibility to work remotely why not choose a different city that has the housing cost
within your set price range and featuring your favorite activities? It would be nice to have a tool that
will help you narrow down your search. With SettleUp, you can specify the price and activity that you
like and get a list of metropolitan areas that have similar cost of living and can provide you
with the way to enjoy your hobbies.
